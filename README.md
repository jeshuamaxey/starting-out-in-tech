# Starting Out In Tech

I was asked recently to give someone advice on how best to learn to code and become better acquainted with the startup and technology scene in London. I replied with a lengthy email and decided to put its contents in a publicly accessible place based on the feedback it received. I don't profess to be an expert on any of this stuff; these are my personal recommendations based on my 3 year's experience of working with technology in London.

## Learning to code
Everyone has a different opinion about how to get into coding. Putting to one side how to teach code to young kids, the majority recommend Python or Javascript. I recommend javascript because combined with HTML and CSS, which are relatively simple to pick up, it's very quick for beginners to see something tangible on the screen (ie a webpage) which I think motivates people to continue more than seeing a load of error messages which can be frightening for first timers.

That said, I've worked a lot with Decoded in the past who preach much the same thing and I don't hide the fact that that shaped my thinking a lot. Their courses are great, but if you're seriously looking to learn to code, there are better and cheaper options.

* [Playto from Decoded](https://learn.playto.io/html-css/lesson/0) is the best intro into HTML and CSS. It won't take very long and it'll get you used to writing code and seeing a visual output. Once you blitz through that, you'll want to learn actual programming. Full disclosure: I used to work a lot with Decoded, but this resources is pretty darn good.
* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is the best place for beginners learning programming for the first time. This is where you should learn javascript. They have v good forums as I recall. Once you can code in one language and want to learn another I think it becomes a bit slow and tedious and you're best off shopping around for something aimed at people who can code, but it's definitely the best place to start.
* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) a great book which teaches you proper javascript programming etiquette. If you feel like there's a particular area you're confused by, read up on it in here. Always good to have a second perspective on a topic. This is a book I wish I'd taken more seriously when I started out.
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) another good source of beginner tutorials. Come here if you get disenchanted by the first two in this list
http://code.org/learn I've never tried code.org but it got a loads of press last year cos everyone who's anyone in silicon valley got involved. My advise would be watch the video, get all inspired and then take that tingly feeling to another site that teaches code better (see above)

You'll likely come across some other common websites before too long. Here's a run down of the good ones:
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is the most trusted site on the web for getting answers to your code problems. Just paste an error into google and a SO answer will come up as the top result
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) I'm recommending this explicitly because when you start out, you'll be googling some HTML and CSS things and a site called W3Schools will be the top result. W3Schools has been known to be erroneous and has refuses to change its name even though it has nothing to do with the W3C. My recommendation would be to add 'mdn' to your google searched for all things HTML and CSS to begin with. Mozilla are trusted sources of all things web

## Getting to know startups:
* [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898): if you haven't already read this, stop what you're doing and order a copy. It'll become your bible when working in startups. Everyone's read it, so should you
* [Google Campus](https://www.campuslondon.com/): a glorified (albeit is sponsored by Google) cafe with good wifi and ok coffee. There are regular events here related to the startup scene in London.

## Mailing Lists I subscribe to:
* [Google Campus](https://www.campuslondon.com/) - for events and stuff
* [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/) - I love this newsletter. Most of it won't make a lot of sense to you when you first start, but they're are tutorials in the sometimes and over time you'll start to recognise more of the topics.
* [Dev Ideas](https://devideas.github.io/): a list of small dev projects people think up. Good source of inspiration for side projects
* [David Kadavy](http://kadavy.net/): a designer on a mission to teach design to hackers. Hover on the homepage until the newsletter signup window appears

## Startup news:
* [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/): they post shit sometimes , but they also get wind of most things first
* [Wired](http://www.wired.co.uk/): the UK site is better focussed to what's going on here, and they're generally a little saner
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): a bit more 'hardcore' but this is usually where news happens first. Here or reddit, but reddit scares me
